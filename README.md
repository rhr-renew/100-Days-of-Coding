## Description
Welcome to my "100 Days of Coding" journey! In this repository, I'll be documenting my daily coding progress as I embark on a 100-day challenge to enhance my programming skills. Throughout this journey, I'll be focusing on learning and mastering various concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. Topics I'll cover include recursion, pointers, and everything from basic to advanced C++ programming.

## Goals
- Learn and implement recursion in various coding challenges.
- Master the usage of pointers and dynamic memory allocation in C++.
- Cover a wide range of DSA topics, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, and searching algorithms.
- Build a strong foundation in C++ programming, progressing from basic syntax to advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming, templates, and STL.

## Structure
- Each day, I'll be committing my code to this repository under the "Days" folder, organized into subfolders labeled with the respective day of the challenge (e.g., "day1_06Feb24").
- The code will include implementations of various DSA concepts, along with explanations and comments to aid understanding.
- Additionally, I'll maintain a detailed log in the README file, documenting my daily progress, challenges faced, and key learnings.

## Join Me
